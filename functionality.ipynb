    "ABOUT:\n",
    "The Text-to-Speech project is a Python program that converts text to speech. It utilizes the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the gtts and playsound libraries for text-to-speech functionality. The user can enter text into a text box, click the \"PLAY\" button, and the program will generate an audio file of the text being spoken aloud. The project is useful for individuals who may have difficulty reading or for anyone who wants to listen to written text rather than reading it."

    "This program can be used in various scenarios in real life, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Educational institutions: The program can be used in educational institutions to assist teachers and students. Teachers can use the program to create audio files for lectures and other educational materials, while students can use it to convert their written notes into audio files for easier studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assistive technology: The program can be used as an assistive technology tool for people with visual impairments or reading difficulties. They can use the program to convert written text into audio files, making it easier for them to access and comprehend the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Business: The program can be used in the business world to create audio files for presentations, podcasts, and other audio materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personal use: The program can be used by individuals for personal use, such as converting written text into audio files for listening while commuting, working out, or doing other activities."

    "This is a program written in Python using the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a text-to-speech application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few lines import the necessary libraries, which are tkinter for GUI, gTTS for converting text to speech, and playsound for playing the audio file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next line creates the main window of the application using the Tk() function and sets the size and background color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, two labels are added to the window using the Label() function. One displays the title of the application and the other displays the name of the developer at the bottom of the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "An entry field is also added to allow the user to input the text that they want to convert to speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function called Text_to_speech() is defined that takes the text from the entry field, converts it to speech using gTTS, saves the audio file, and plays it using the playsound library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two more functions, Exit() and Reset(), are defined to close the application and clear the input field, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, three buttons are added to the window using the Button() function. One button plays the speech, one button exits the application, and one button clears the input field.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app.mainloop() function runs the main loop of the application, which waits for user input and responds accordingly."

    "The Tk() function is a constructor provided by the tkinter library in Python to create a top-level GUI window or a main window for the application. When this function is called, it initializes and sets up the main window of the application, which is a container for all the widgets like buttons, labels, entry fields, etc. that will be added to the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tk() function creates an instance of the tkinter.Tk class, which represents the main window. It takes no arguments by default, but you can specify some optional arguments to customize the window, such as its size, title, and background color.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the main window, you can add widgets to it using various tkinter methods like Label(), Button(), Entry(), etc. Once you have added all the necessary widgets to the window, you can call the mainloop() method on the main window object, which starts the event loop and waits for the user to interact with the widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the user interacts with the widgets, such as clicking a button or typing in an entry field, the event loop detects the event and executes the appropriate callback function assigned to the widget's event. The event loop continues to run until the main window is closed or the application is exited."
